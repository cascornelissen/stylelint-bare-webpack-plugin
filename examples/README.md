# Examples
This directory includes basic examples on how you could use the `stylelint-bare-webpack-plugin`. You can run these examples yourself by cloning the repository, navigating to one of the example directories and running the `webpack` command from there.

```shell
$ cd <path-to-repository>/examples/<example>
$ ../../node_modules/.bin/webpack
``` 

Since the `stylelint` package itself is not included in this package you'll have to install it manually to run any of the examples.

```shell
$ npm i stylelint --no-save
```
